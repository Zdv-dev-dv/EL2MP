The **Écologies des Pratiques (EL2MP)** project explores the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on research, creativity, and communication across various domains. Developed using SvelteKit, this initiative combines cutting-edge technological tools with critical reflection on their implications. Supported by Google through its commitment to advancing ethical and impactful AI practices.

## Project Overview

At the heart of this project lies a **collaborative and interdisciplinary approach**, engaging researchers, practitioners, and students from diverse fields. By experimenting with LLMs, we aim to understand their potential as catalysts for new forms of knowledge production and dissemination while addressing the ecological and ethical questions they raise.

The project focuses on three key areas:

### 1. Technological Experimentation

Integrating LLMs into practical workflows to assess how these tools reshape academic and professional practices. From creative writing to data analysis, the project tests the boundaries of LLMs' generative capabilities.

### 2. Critical Reflection

Fostering discussions on the broader societal and ecological implications of LLM adoption:

- What are the costs and benefits of scaling these technologies?
- How do they challenge or reinforce existing structures of knowledge and power?

### 3. Community Building

Building a community of thinkers and makers through workshops, public events, and collaborative platforms to collectively imagine and shape the future of AI-driven practices.

## Technology Highlights

This project leverages modern web technologies to create an interactive and engaging experience:

- **Framework:** Built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a fast and efficient user interface.
- **Interactivity:** Uses [Interact.js](https://interactjs.io/) for dynamic element manipulation.
- **Custom Components:** Features bespoke Svelte components tailored to the project's needs.
- **Key Libraries:** Incorporates libraries like [Simplebar](https://github.com/Grsmto/simplebar) for custom scrolling and potentially [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for graphical elements.

## Project Structure

The codebase follows standard [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) conventions, organizing routes within `src/routes` and utilizing shared components and utilities located in `src/lib`. Content data is managed separately, likely within `Content_data.js` and integrated through server-side functions or components.

## Project Support

With Google's support, **Écologies des Pratiques** not only investigates the possibilities of LLMs but also critically examines their role within contemporary ecological, cultural, and institutional systems. By bridging technological innovation and critical inquiry, this project seeks to illuminate how these powerful tools can contribute responsibly to a sustainable and inclusive future.
