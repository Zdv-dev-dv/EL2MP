Some exercises introduce deliberate pauses in professional routines, causing participants to take a step back from their own practices: during these pauses, judgment is suspended, giving users enough room to question their instinctive habits and feel unsure about what they once thought was certain. Other exercises aim to intensify the use of LLMs to shed light on what would otherwise remain too subtle to be perceived.<br><b>An ecological archive of practices:</b> The digital traces from LLM use serve as the starting point for the exercises we designed. They are analysed, contextualised, and discussed individually and collectively. Through this process, participants progressively build a multimodal archive (audio, photos, videos, drawings, and logbooks) that tangibly reflects their LLMs experience and how they are incorporated into various professional norms and material configurations.<br><b>A workbook (vademecum):</b> The workbook collects all the exercises and their instructions, organized into thematic blocks. Designed as a modular object, where pages can be added or removed as needed, it accompanies each participant throughout the protocol. The vademecum serves as both the material support for the protocol and the project's means of dissemination, as it can be reproduced and adapted in various academic and professional contexts.",

Some exercises introduce <b>deliberate pauses</b> in professional routines, causing participants to take a <b>step back</b> from their own practices: during these pauses, judgment is suspended, giving users enough room to <b>question</b> their instinctive habits and feel unsure about what they once thought was certain. Other exercises aim to <b>intensify the use of LLMs</b> to shed light on what would otherwise remain too subtle to be perceived.<br><br><b>An ecological archive of practices:</b> The digital traces from LLM use serve as the <b>starting point</b> for the exercises we designed. They are <b>analysed, contextualised, and discussed</b> individually and collectively. Through this process, participants progressively build a <b>multimodal archive</b> (audio, photos, videos, drawings, and logbooks) that tangibly reflects their LLMs experience and how they are incorporated into various <b>professional norms</b> and material configurations.<br><br><b>A workbook (vademecum):</b> The workbook collects all the exercises and their instructions, organized into <b>thematic blocks</b>. Designed as a <b>modular object</b>, where pages can be added or removed as needed, it accompanies each participant throughout the protocol.
