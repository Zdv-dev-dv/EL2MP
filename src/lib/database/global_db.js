          "To carry out the project, we developed an experimental research protocol based on the active involvement of participants.

Some exercises introduce deliberate pauses in professional routines, causing participants to take a step back from their own practices: during these pauses, judgment is suspended, giving users enough room to question their instinctive habits and feel unsure about what they once thought was certain. Other exercises aim to intensify the use of LLMs to shed light on what would otherwise remain too subtle to be perceived.\n\nAn ecological archive of practices: The digital traces from LLM use serve as the starting point for the exercises we designed. They are analysed, contextualised, and discussed individually and collectively. Through this process, participants progressively build a multimodal archive (audio, photos, videos, drawings, and logbooks) that tangibly reflects their LLMs experience and how they are incorporated into various professional norms and material configurations.\n\nA workbook (vademecum): The workbook collects all the exercises and their instructions, organized into thematic blocks. Designed as a modular object, where pages can be added or removed as needed, it accompanies each participant throughout the protocol. The vademecum serves as both the material support for the protocol and the project's means of dissemination, as it can be reproduced and adapted in various academic and professional contexts.",

const projectDescription =
  "The Ã‰cologies des Pratiques project explores the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on research, creativity, and communication across various domains. Supported by Google through its commitment to advancing ethical and impactful AI practices, this initiative combines cutting-edge technological tools with critical reflection on their implications. <br><br>At the heart of this project lies a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach, engaging researchers, practitioners, and students from diverse fields. By experimenting with LLMs, we seek to understand their potential as catalysts for new forms of knowledge production and dissemination while addressing the ecological and ethical questions they raise. The project delves into three key areas: <br><br> Technological Experimentation: By integrating LLMs into practical workflows, we assess how these tools reshape academic and professional practices. From creative writing to data analysis, the project tests the boundaries of LLMs' generative capabilities.<br><br> Critical Reflection: Alongside experimentation, we foster discussions on the broader societal and ecological implications of LLM adoption. What are the costs and benefits of scaling these technologies? How do they challenge or reinforce existing structures of knowledge and power?<br><br> Community Building: Through workshops, public events, and collaborative platforms, we aim to build a community of thinkers and makers who can collectively imagine and shape the future of AI-driven practices.<br><br> With Google's support, Ã‰cologies des Pratiques not only investigates the possibilities of LLMs but also critically examines their role within contemporary ecological, cultural, and institutional systems. By bridging technological innovation and critical inquiry, this project seeks to illuminate how these powerful tools can contribute responsibly to a sustainable and inclusive future.";
