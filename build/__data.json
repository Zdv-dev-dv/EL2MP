The fruit of a collaboration between sociologists, science and technology researchers (STS), and designers, this protocol aims to create:\n\nRoom for hesitation: Through a series of exercises, the protocol provides participants with various means of documenting and reflecting on their use of LLMs. We aim to establish a framework where doubt and hesitation are not only accepted but encouraged. Some exercises introduce deliberate pauses in professional routines, causing participants to take a step back from their own practices: during these pauses, judgment is suspended, giving users enough room to question their instinctive habits and feel unsure about what they once thought was certain. Other exercises aim to intensify the use of LLMs to shed light on what would otherwise remain too subtle to be perceived.\n\nAn ecological archive of practices: The digital traces from LLM use serve as the starting point for the exercises we designed. They are analysed, contextualised, and discussed individually and collectively. Through this process, participants progressively build a multimodal archive (audio, photos, videos, drawings, and logbooks) that tangibly reflects their LLMs experience and how they are incorporated into various professional norms and material configurations.\n\nA workbook (vademecum): The workbook collects all the exercises and their instructions, organized into thematic blocks. Designed as a modular object, where pages can be added or removed as needed, it accompanies each participant throughout the protocol. The vademecum serves as both the material support for the protocol and the project's means of dissemination, as it can be reproduced and adapted in various academic and professional contexts.",{"sources":23,"img":27},{"avif":24,"webp":25,"jpeg":26},"/EL2MP/_app/immutable/assets/Ex_1.M4ljEBhX.avif 1694w, /EL2MP/_app/immutable/assets/Ex_1.CMMh1Vzj.avif 3387w","/EL2MP/_app/immutable/assets/Ex_1.Bx3NSCaH.webp 1694w, /EL2MP/_app/immutable/assets/Ex_1.DrrkBwoK.webp 3387w","/EL2MP/_app/immutable/assets/Ex_1.jWrIf0p7.jpeg 1694w, /EL2MP/_app/immutable/assets/Ex_1.YYmuPqAp.jpeg 3387w",{"src":28,"w":29,"h":30},"/EL2MP/_app/immutable/assets/Ex_1.YYmuPqAp.jpeg",3387,4853,{"title":32,"subtitle":33,"text":34,"picture":35},"Exercise 2 - Harvesting Tasks","Participants account for the tasks they perform in their work and how LLMs could assist them","This exercise helps participants reflect on their existing work, revealing overlooked or underappreciated tasks.
